    "description": "Painting from the model can be difficult to navigate, balancing colour, tone, proportions, perspective, composition, and emotional narrative. Through this class we will get back to the basics of life-painting, referencing the work of some of the great life-painters, William Etty, Lucien Freud, Euan Uglow, Jenny Saville and more, mining their work for their wisdom on painting TONE, all whilst using yourself as the model!",
